### Marhaba! 👋

I love great UI's and Im currently leading frontend development for [one of UAE's leading e-commerce websites](https://www.noon.com). I like to dabble around with multiple frameworks at the same time(maybe/maybe not a great way to learn, but hey it works for me!)

- 🌱 I’m currently learning **three.js** through their brilliant documentation and with a little help from [Bruno Simon](https://threejs-journey.xyz/)
- 🌱 I’m also dabbling with OpenAI Apps SDK to build agentic AI workflows
- 💬 Ask me about all things React and design-rich frontends.
